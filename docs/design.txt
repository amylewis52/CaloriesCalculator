Problem Statement: 

Create a program that calculates a persons caloric needs. The calories will be calculated from input of the user entering their height, current weight, age, and activity level. The output will be their current calories needed to maintain their weight. 

Nouns: calories, height, weight, age, activity level

Verbs: calculates, entering, input, output


Inputs: 
Height
Weight 
Age
Activity level


Processes: 
Prompt user for gender
Prompt user for height
Prompt user for weight
Prompt user for activity level
Prompt user for age
Calculate calories based off inputs
Ask user if they would like to calculate again.
Display output

Output: 
Caloric needs

Pseudocode: 

CalorieCalculator
  Initialize bmr
  Initialize gender
  initialize weight
  Initialize height
  Initialize age
  Initialize activityLevel
  Initialize caloriesCalculated
  Initialize addCalculation = "Yes"
  Initialize factor
  Initialize numOfCalculation = 0


  While statement (addCalculation = "Yes)
    Prompt user for gender
    Prompt user for weight
    Prompt user for height
    Prompt user for age
    Prompt user for activityLevel
    Prompt user for addCalculation

    If gender = "Female" use bmr = 447.6 + (9.2 * weight) + (3.1 * height) - (4.3 * age)
    Else if gender = "Male" use bmr = 88.36 + (13.4 * weight) + (4.8 * height) - (5.7 * age)

    Switch for activityLevel
    Case "Sedentary" 
    Factor 1.2
    Case "Moderate"
    Factor 1.5
    Case "Active"
    Factory 1.8

    Calculate calories = bmr * factor
    Increment numOfCalculations

    Output the calculation of calories
    If addCalculations != "Yes" 
  END Loop
  
  Display "Thank you!" 
    
END
